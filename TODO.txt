TODO AlchemyTec Coding Test:
- KIND OF WORKING SOMETIMES AND ONLY WITH NO API PREFIX:
 now it is working sometimes, but api is at localhost:8080/expenses
  and website at localhost:8080/default.html (no api prefix).
==> works for adding data once or so in chromium with netbeans connector, (then added a line with firefox), then reloaded chromium, then showed 404 does not exist (from now on chromium with netbeans connector will say localhost:8080 does not exist, localhost:8080/index.html does not exist, localhost:8080/default.hmlt does not exist, BUT FIREFOX WILL STILL DISPLAY ALL THESE PAGES AND EVEN ADD NEW ENTRIES INTO THE DB THAT ACTUALLY SHOW UP INSIDE MYSQL TABLE!!
 -> TRY TO PUT API INTO api/ PREFIX (easy to do in java, but in angular need to edit angular.services.js (line 139 or so) AND THEN RECOMPILE THE JS STUFF WITH gulp??


- del index.html and make default.html default
- make junit tests of the webservices (a webseervice java ee 7 client that calls them)
 
- once web code can call my code api, fork repo and start from scxratch and call project AlchemyCodingTest and webpath / or /alchemy/ (and + api/)

- beautify


- don't do these:
    - move static/ folder somewhere appropriately? (note: resources/static/ does not work, not copied into webapp dir by maven, could just leave static in webapp folder as is!)
