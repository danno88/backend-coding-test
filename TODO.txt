TODO AlchemyTec Coding Test:


- del index.html and make default.html default
- make junit tests of the webservices (a webseervice java ee 7 client that calls them)
 
- once web code can call my code api, fork repo and start from scxratch and call project AlchemyCodingTest and webpath / or /alchemy/ (and + api/)

- beautify


- don't do these:
    - move static/ folder somewhere appropriately? (note: resources/static/ does not work, not copied into webapp dir by maven, could just leave static in webapp folder as is!)
