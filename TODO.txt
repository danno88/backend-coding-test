TODO AlchemyTec Coding Test:
=> consider security of app!

- I don't see an issue with Firefox 36:
    all seems to be working fine with FF 36 and Chromium 37 
    (both show the error messages if trying to submit empty form or fields, both show db data as expected and add their new entries properly to the db)!
    [only in webkit browser inside netbeans the error messages of input fields are not shown, but doesn't submit anyway]
    [all tested under Ubuntu 12.04 64bit]



- consider doing:
    - move src/main/webapp/static/ folder somewhere appropriately? (note: resources/static/ does not work, not copied into webapp dir by maven, could just leave static in webapp folder as is!)
